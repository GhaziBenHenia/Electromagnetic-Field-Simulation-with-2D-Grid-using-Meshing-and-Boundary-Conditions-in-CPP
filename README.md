# 2D-Electromagnetic-Field-Simulation-with-Mesh-and-Absorbing-Boundaries
This project is a C++ implementation of an electromagnetic wave simulation. The goal is to calculate the electric and magnetic fields to determine the electromagnetic waves in a 2D grid using meshing. The project aims to demonstrate concepts in physics, such as wave propagation and field interactions, using numerical methods.
